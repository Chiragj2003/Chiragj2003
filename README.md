### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
As an Intern I am currently looking forward to making a long-term carrier in Software development. As a passionate Python Developer, I thrive on creating innovative solutions and tackling complex challenges through coding. With a solid foundation in Python programming, I possess a good understanding of its versatile capabilities, libraries, and frameworks. I am excited to contribute my Python proficiency and problem-solving abilities to create cutting-edge software solutions that address real-world needs and make a positive impact on users' lives. And I have knowledge about Front-end web development which includes HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript. My strong communication skills allow me to easily communicate with people of different backgrounds and work with them easily and efficiently. I am a fast learner and an extremely handworker.
